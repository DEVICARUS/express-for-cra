## Docs

### Routing

All files in the `routes` directory are automaticaly `required()` as Express routers, meaning all you have to do is to create a new file in this directory (take a look at the `users` example).

### Create React App

The production server pulls the app from the `client/build` folder, so remember to build your CRA-based app for the production. 

### Generator

The generator is a simple script for creating new Mongoose models (and other things) using the templates from the `templates` directory. Simply run `yarn run generator` to start using it.

**Currently supports**

- Mongoose models

- Express routes
